# Configuration

Consistent configuration is one of the core values of the project.

We like our lakehouses to be uniform in terms of loading patterns, table structures, tracking, etc. At the same time, we want to keep it [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

bifabrik configuration aims to cover many aspects of the lakehouse so that you can define your conventions once, use it repeatedly, and override when neccessary.
